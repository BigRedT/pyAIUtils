# Introduction
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aiUIUC/pyAIUtils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aiUIUC/pyAIUtils)

This python package provides useful scripts, functions and classes for building AI systems. Many of these functions and classes are intended to be simple wrappers around other libraries and packages. This can save researchers from having to deal with a ton of clumsy boilerplate code that is a part and parcel of libraries like tensorflow. 

# Organization
The package is organized into 3 main parts:
- vis : utility functions for computer vision 
- lang : utility functions for natural language processing 
- tftools : utility functions for tensorflow / deep learning


Have fun contributing and using :smile:.
